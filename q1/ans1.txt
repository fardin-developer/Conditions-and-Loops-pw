Conditional statements are programming instructions that make decisions based 
on certain conditions. They allow the computer to execute specific code blocks
if a condition is true and different code blocks if the condition is false.
In simple terms, conditional statements help control the flow of a program, 
enabling it to respond dynamically to different situations.
